<p>This option will force the build to consume all executors on the node it runs on. If there are builds currently running on the node, the job will wait.<p>

<p><b>NOTE</b>:The build must be restricted to the self label (node name) or master. All other labels are defaulted to the Job Weight set above. This plugin also supports <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/NodeLabel+Parameter+Plugin">NodeLabel Parameter Plugin</a>.</p>
